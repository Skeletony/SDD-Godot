In this folder, you can find various scenes and tools to test some of the scenes of your actual game project.

These scenes are not intended to be shipped with your game, you may want to use them only for testing purposes, such as:

- RichTextLabels screen clamping (rtl_screen_clamping.tscn)
	This scene helps you test the RichTextLabels used in your game, such as labels used when pointing an item or NPC or dialogs.
	To use this testing scene, simply add your actual label scene as a child of the root node and set the path to this node in it.
	You can then run the scene, move your mouse around the edges of the screen and see if the label reacts properly.
